This paper examines the household economics of Tomoko Matsudaira, a Japanese female economist, with a specific focus on the issue of wise consumption within Matsudaira’s expenditure theory. The exploration includes Matsudaira’s definition and criteria for wise consumption, her perspectives on consumer cooperatives guiding wise consumption within the household, her views on the influence of the consumer environment outside the household, and consumer awareness of wise consumption. This paper is the first ever investigation of Matsudaira’s views on wise consumption in English, and it primarily relies on Matsudaira’s debut work, Household Economics (1925a), but also references her later works to discern whether Matsudaira’s perspectives on wise consumption changed or developed over her more than forty years of research in household economics. This paper aims to provide theoretical insights into wise consumption by exploring Matsudaira’s discussions on household economics.
