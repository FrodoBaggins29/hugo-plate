Imagine a really long family history project, but instead of just your family, it's about seven different families in a specific area of China (Tongcheng County) going all the way back 600 years!

Here's what the study looked at;

They looked at families across many generations: They focused on fathers and their sons for 18 generations, which is a huge amount of time! This means they had information on about 40,000 people.
They looked at all kinds of people: These families weren't all rich or all poor. They included everyone from regular folks to people who had earned a very high-level academic degree called a "jinshi." Think of it like having a PhD back then, which opened doors to important jobs.
They wanted to see how much people's social class changed over time: This is what "intergenerational mobility" means. Did a farmer's son also become a farmer, or did he have a chance to become something else, maybe even a highly educated official? Did the sons of those high-ranking officials stay at the top?
What they found:
Change was slow but it happened: For a long time, people's social class didn't change much from one generation to the next.
Things got a lot more mobile in the 1600s: Suddenly, it became more likely for people to move up or down the social ladder.
The timing makes sense: This change in the 1600s lines up with other important historical events that would have affected opportunities for both regular people and the highly educated.
Something interesting about inequality: They also found that when there was less social mobility (meaning people tended to stay in the same social class as their parents), there was more inequality in society. This is like saying if it's hard to move up, the gap between the rich and poor tends to be bigger. This idea is called the "Great Gatsby curve," and this study found evidence of it happening over time, not just at one point in time.
So, in simpler terms, this study used a massive amount of family history data to see how much people's social standing changed in China over six centuries. They discovered that while change was gradual, there was a significant period of increased social movement in the 1600s, and they also found a connection between how easy it was to move up or down in society and how unequal society was overall. Pretty cool, right?

## intergenerational mobility

Think about it like this: intergenerational mobility is basically how likely it is for kids to end up in a different income bracket than their parents. If there's high mobility, it means a kid born into a poor family has a good chance of becoming wealthy, and vice versa. If there's low mobility, kids tend to stay in the same economic situation as their parents.

This idea of intergenerational mobility is a really important way to understand how fair or equal an economy is.

Recently, studies comparing different regions today have shown that there can be big differences in how much mobility there is. These differences might be because of things like:

Government taxes: How the government collects and spends money.
Neighborhoods: The kind of community someone grows up in.
Community groups: Things like local clubs or organizations.
Innate population characteristics: This is a bit more complex, but it could refer to things like the general skills or education levels of people in a region.
Other stuff: Basically, lots of different factors can play a role.
Now, when we try to understand how mobility worked before the 1800s, it gets much harder. We don't have as much information.

One of the big problems with studying how mobility changes over time is that things that are passed down through families (like maybe certain skills or connections) don't usually change very quickly. So, if we only look at parents and their kids, or even grandparents and grandkids, that might not be enough time to see a real trend. We need to look at many, many generations to really understand how social mobility has changed over long periods.

So, this paragraph is basically saying that understanding how much kids' economic futures are tied to their parents' is key to understanding an economy. We know that different things now can affect this mobility. But it's tough to know how it worked way back in the past because things that influence it change slowly, so we need to study many generations to see any real changes over time.

## Ancient Chinese Exams

Okay, imagine historians who study China have always been super curious about how easy it was for people to move up or down in society. They've especially focused on how people got into and out of the top levels of society – like becoming powerful officials.

Think of it like this: they're trying to figure out if China was a place where anyone could become the "cool kids" or if the "cool kids" always stayed the same families.

One famous historian named Ho, who studied the Ming and Qing dynasties (a long time ago in China), said that the big civil service exams were the most important thing for deciding your social status. He even thought these exams became more important than just being from a fancy family. Basically, he argued that doing well on these tests could make you important, even if your family wasn't.

Another historian, Kracke, asked a similar question: "Did these civil service exams bring in new people from different backgrounds into the government?" He wanted to know if it was a way for people who weren't born into privilege to get important jobs.

Even before Kracke, a writer named Wittfogel looked at the biographies of officials from way back in Chinese history (from the Tang to the Qing dynasties). He thought that while the exam system might have let some new people in from lower social classes, for the most part, the powerful officials were mostly coming from families who were already powerful. It was like the "ruling class" mostly stayed within itself.

To get a better idea, Kracke looked at who got the highest degree, called the jinshi degree, before the Ming dynasty. He tried to find out what the fathers, grandfathers, and great-grandfathers of these successful students did. This helped him see if these high achievers came from families with a history of being important.

Ho also did something similar but for the entire Ming dynasty. He looked at all the people who got the top jinshi degree (over 22,000 of them!). He found that only a small percentage – about 7 out of every 100 – came from families that were officially known as "scholar" families. This suggests that maybe the exams did create some opportunities for people from less privileged backgrounds to rise to the top.

So, basically, these historians were trying to figure out how people became important in China's past. They were especially interested in whether the civil service exams were a fair way for anyone to move up in society or if being from a well-known family was still the most important thing. Their research gives us clues about how open or closed Chinese society was at different times.

## Kracke and Ho

Okay, so even though historians like Kracke and Ho found that it seemed easier than expected for people to move into the highest levels of Chinese society, it's not something everyone agrees on.

Think of it like this: they found some evidence that the "cool kids" club wasn't always made up of the same families. People from less privileged backgrounds could sometimes work their way in.

However, more recent research, often looking at family history records (genealogies), has pointed out many cases where the rich and powerful families managed to stay rich and powerful for generations. It's like some families just had a knack for staying on top.

Ho himself even mentioned that the evidence he and others had about this "social fluidity" (how easily people could move up or down) was mostly based on stories, family trees, novels, and what people at the time said about clans and families. It wasn't always hard, cold numbers.

But, Ho also used family trees to show that even high-status families could lose their position if their kids or grandkids weren't capable. So, it wasn't always guaranteed that you'd stay on top just because your parents were.

Basically, what this paragraph is saying is that the picture is complicated. History shows us examples of families that stayed powerful for a long time, but also examples of powerful families losing their status. So, while there might have been some opportunities for people to move up, it wasn't always a one-way street, and the old powerful families still had ways of trying to stay in charge. It's a mix of things.

## Father and Son

Okay, so we've talked a lot about the fancy folks and how they moved up or down. But what about everyone else – the regular people who weren't part of the elite? We don't know as much about their social mobility during the Ming and Qing dynasties.

That's where this research paper comes in! The person who wrote it is saying, "Hey, I'm going to use all the cool information in those Chinese family history books (genealogies) to actually measure how social mobility changed over time for everyone, not just the top guys."

They looked at a wide range of social classes, from everyday commoners all the way up to those who got the super prestigious jinshi degree.

Here's what they did:

They looked at a specific place and families: They studied seven different families (clans) living in Tongcheng County over a long period, from around the 1300s to the 1900s.
They tracked a lot of people: They had information on about 9,800 men and almost 9,000 father-son pairs in their sample. Around the year 1790, this group of people made up about 2% of the total population of that county.
Where was this place? Tongcheng County was located in a certain area of China, near a big river and not too far from the sea.1   

## Gena-what?

Okay, so think of these genealogies – those Chinese family history books we've been talking about – as really valuable sources of information about people's social and economic lives way back then.

The author even points out that while not every country keeps these kinds of detailed family records, when they do exist (like in China), they're considered a super reliable way to study how people's status changes over many generations. In fact, for linking historical information about families in the United States, they've even been called "the gold standard" – meaning the very best!

However, there's a potential problem: not every single family in China kept a genealogy. So, the families we do have records for might not be a perfect representation of everyone. It's like if you only surveyed people who owned fancy cars – you wouldn't get a good idea of what most people drive.

To deal with this potential bias (where the families we study might be special in some way), the author explains that they used a careful method to pick the families in their study. They tried to choose families in a way that would give them a sample that was more like a good cross-section of society at the time.

Because of this careful selection, the people in their study come from all sorts of backgrounds. There are very few people who achieved that super high jinshi degree (only about 0.2% of their sample), which makes sense because it was really hard to get. And the majority of the people in their sample (around 70%) were regular, everyday folks (commoners), which also reflects what society was probably like back then.

So, this paragraph is saying that these family history books are great for studying social mobility, but you have to be careful about which families you look at. The author made an effort to pick families that represent the different social classes in China at the time, so their findings are more likely to give us a realistic picture.

## The Matrices

So, the author looked at their data from those family history books and created something called "transition matrices." Think of these like charts that show how likely it was for someone to move from one social class to another between generations (from father to son).

What they found for the jinshi (the super high-achievers) was interesting. They discovered that about 7% of fathers who were jinshi also had sons who became jinshi. Guess what? That's very close to the 7.1% that the historian Ho found in his research! It's like their numbers match up.

However, the author has a slightly different way of looking at this compared to Ho. While Ho might have seen this as some level of movement (since not all jinshi fathers had jinshi sons), this author sees it as a sign that family status tended to stick around at the top.

Here's why: the author also found that for every three sons of a jinshi, one of them (that's about 33%) stayed within the top 2% of the social ladder. Think of it like the very top of the pyramid – even if they didn't get the exact same jinshi title, they still remained in a very elite group.

The author also points out something really cool that you can't find in official government records: they were able to track how people moved within the groups just below the elite and even among the regular, non-elite folks. So, they got a much broader picture of social mobility across all levels of society, not just at the very top.

In simple terms: even though not every jinshi father had a jinshi son, the author's research suggests that if you were from a top family, there was a pretty good chance your son would also end up near the top. Plus, they were able to see how mobility worked for everyone else in society, which is something we didn't really know much about before.

## 50-50

Okay, imagine a game where your parents give you a head start in life, maybe because they have more money or better connections. This research suggests that whatever advantage your parents give you, it gets cut in half in your generation. So, if your parents gave you a 10-point advantage, you'd likely only have a 5-point advantage over someone whose parents didn't have those resources.

However, this average picture hides some really interesting changes that happened over time, both for people moving up and for people moving down the social ladder.

What the study found is that mobility increased over time, both ways:

Upward mobility increased: This means that fewer sons born into poor families stayed poor as time went on. They had a better chance of climbing up the social ladder.
Downward mobility increased: This also means that fewer sons from very rich families stayed very rich. There was a greater chance they might fall down the social ladder.
Interestingly, this wasn't always the case. The study suggests that mobility was low until around the middle of the 1600s. It was harder for people to change their social standing. But then, starting from the late 1600s, mobility increased significantly. Things became more fluid, with more movement both up and down.

Overall, the main takeaway is that the advantage that kids from high-status families had over kids from lower-status families got smaller over time. It became less guaranteed that you'd stay rich if your parents were rich, and it became more possible to climb out of poverty. The author says that this increase in mobility is a pretty solid finding, even when they checked their results in different ways.

So, in simpler terms: while your parents' advantages still give you a boost, that boost isn't as strong as it used to be, and over time, it became easier for people to move up or down the social ladder, especially after the 1600s.

## Ka-Qing

Okay, so why did this increase in social mobility happen after the 1600s? The author suggests we need to look at how much the economy valued skills and education during that time, both in terms of what was actually happening historically and the rules and systems that were in place.

Think of it like this: if the economy starts to reward people more for what they know and what they can do (their skills and education) rather than just who their parents are, then you'd expect to see more social mobility. People from less privileged backgrounds could climb up if they gained valuable skills. Also, people from wealthy families might fall if they didn't develop those skills.

The author points out that the timing of this increase in mobility roughly lines up with the beginning of new policies that the Qing Dynasty put in place in the 1600s. 1  This suggests that these new rules and systems might have played a role in making society more mobile. Perhaps these policies created more opportunities for people with skills and education, regardless of their family background

So, in simple terms: the shift towards more social mobility after the 1600s might be because the economy started valuing what you learned and what you could do more than just your family name. And this change seems to have happened around the same time that the new government (the Qing Dynasty) started introducing new rules and ways of doing things. These new policies might have opened up more paths for people to move up or down the social ladder based on their own abilities.

## The Great Gatsby

Okay, so when how much you earn depends more on your skills and education (what economists call "return to human capital"), it doesn't just affect how easy it is to move up or down in society (mobility). It also affects how unequal society is.

Think about it this way: if everyone has a chance to gain skills and get educated, and those things lead to better jobs and higher pay, then the gap between the rich and the poor might shrink. More people have a shot at doing well.

The author points out that this connection between mobility and inequality has been seen in studies comparing different regions today. This idea is known as the Great Gatsby curve, which basically says that places with less social mobility tend to have more income inequality.

What's really interesting is that this study found the same pattern happening over time in China. As social mobility increased (meaning it became easier to move up or down), income inequality actually decreased. It's like the pie was being shared more evenly.

So, the author is showing that the changes they observed in China over centuries have something fundamental in common with what we see when we compare different places in the world today. When there's more opportunity for people to change their social standing, there tends to be less of a gap between the rich and the poor. It's like these two things – mobility and equality – are connected.

## Pseudo Science

Alright, let's break down how this research paper adds to what we know:

This study helps us understand how social mobility worked during the Ming and Qing Dynasties (a long time ago in China). Before this, we didn't have a lot of hard numbers or statistical analysis on this topic. Most of what we knew was based on stories and less concrete evidence.

Think of it like trying to understand the weather from old diaries instead of having actual temperature readings and weather maps.

For periods in history before governments started collecting really good, representative data (like detailed census information), researchers have had to get creative. They've used things called "pseudo-links," which are often based on people having the same last name. The idea is that if people share a rare surname, they might be related, and you can try to track them that way.

These older methods are useful and can give us some clues, and this new paper using family histories (genealogies) adds another important piece to the puzzle.

While these family history books might not have information on every single person like a census would, they have a big advantage when it comes to following families across generations. The relationships – who the parents and children are – are clearly laid out in the genealogies. It's like having a ready-made family tree that shows the connections directly.

So, this paper uses these family trees to give us a more direct way of seeing how social status was passed down (or not) from one generation to the next, which is a key part of understanding intergenerational mobility. It's adding a new and valuable type of evidence to the historical picture.

## Up-low, Down-top

Okay, so remember how some important studies about social mobility in China, like the one by Ho, mostly looked at the very top people – the 1 to 5 percent who did really well in those tough civil service exams?

Well, the family history records (genealogies) let us look at a wider idea of "status." It's not just about getting those top exam scores. We can also see people who might have been wealthy or had some social standing even if they didn't have super high levels of education. Think of successful merchants or landowners – they might not have been top scholars, but they still had a certain level of status.

What's really important about this research paper is that it looks at a sample where more than 70 percent of the men were not elites. This group includes regular commoners and people from lower social classes.

So, this study is doing something new! It's not just focusing on the tiny sliver at the very top. It's digging into the lives and the mobility patterns of the vast majority of China's population – the everyday people. This means the results of this paper give us a much better and broader understanding of how social mobility worked for most people in China during that time, not just for the super-achieving scholars. It's like finally getting to see the whole picture instead of just a small corner of it.

## Donuts ,Danishe's,and snuff 

Okay, so this paper also connects to a lot of other research that looks at social mobility, both in the world today and going back to the 1800s. Many of these studies use a method called the "intergenerational regression approach." Think of this as a way of statistically measuring how much your parents' social or economic status influences your own.

The author mentions that their research shows a big change over several centuries in something called the "generational coefficient." This is a number that tells you how strongly your parents' status predicts your status. In this study, that number went down from 0.7 to 0.4. A lower number means that your parents' status has less of a hold on your future – in other words, more mobility.

The author then compares this finding to other studies:

One study found some changes in social mobility in Germany since the late 1800s.
Another study suggested that social mobility in the U.S. has actually decreased since 1880.
Studies on 19th-century Sweden found mobility estimates somewhere in the middle.
Research on 19th-century jobs in the U.S. and the UK found even higher levels of mobility (a lower coefficient).
The author points out that the fact that social mobility can be different in different regions might explain why these other studies have different results. By looking at how this "generational coefficient" changed over time in the same region of China, this paper aims to give us a better understanding of how mobility changes across different periods, which is something we don't know as much about compared to how mobility differs from place to place.

So, in simple terms: this research fits into a bigger picture of studies trying to measure how much parents influence their children's social standing. By tracking this influence over a long period in one specific area of China, this paper helps us understand how social mobility can change over time, adding to what we know from comparing different countries or time periods.

## 1

One area of research starts with Ho's influential 1962 work on social mobility during the Ming and Qing dynasties. This study looked at the life stories of people who successfully passed China's civil service exams and suggested that there was more upward movement among the elite than previously thought. Other researchers, using excellent historical records, have built upon this work, including Huang (Reference Huang 2016) and Chang (Reference Chang 2023). Jiang and Kung (2020) specifically highlight the significance of "cultural capital"—meaning having a high-ranking ancestor—compared to having resources for success in the highest-level exams during the long 19th century (1796–1905). By concentrating on top graduates like *juren* and *jinshi* (those who passed provincial and national exams, respectively), this research offers insights into how mobility worked within the top 5 percent of society.

**Footnote 8:** This research has yielded interesting findings.

**Footnote 9:** However, the patterns of mobility within China's top 5 percent are different from the mobility patterns of the entire Chinese population.

## 1.2

Another area of research has looked at how things get passed down through generations by studying family records from Liaoning province in Northern China between 1749 and 1909 (Lee and Campbell 1997; Campbell and Lee 2003; Mare and Song 2014). Campbell and Lee (2011) even combined this information with surveys from the 1900s. This research emphasizes that your family from earlier generations and your wider relatives played a big role in whether you moved up in society, not just your parents (this idea is also supported by Solon 2014; Braun and Stuhler 2018; Keller and Shiue 2023).

The good thing about the Liaoning records is that they are more complete than most Chinese family histories we know about today. However, a downside is that the Liaoning data doesn't really represent all of China. This is because about three out of every four men in their study were farmers who inherited their job. For the other men (who were prisoners of war, nobles who were forced to move, and farmers with special jobs), their job choices were even more limited.

**Footnote 10:** Also, the Liaoning records only go back to the mid-1700s. This is too late to see important changes and increases in social mobility that happened when job restrictions started to disappear in the late Ming dynasty (Watson and Ebrey 1991) and when more people could take the civil service exams during the change from the Ming to the Qing dynasty (Ho 1962). In contrast, the information we are looking at in *this* study is a better representation of the job restrictions in China at that time and covers a longer period of more than two or three centuries. Plus, the kind of information found in family histories is really important for answering the questions we're asking.

## 1.3

A third area of growing interest is figuring out how family history records (genealogies) can help us study things that happen over many generations. Some recent work has used these records to understand how people reacted to population pressures (called Malthusian responses), how they used education and skills to deal with big problems, how diseases caused by the environment spread, and what limited people's ability to move (Hu 2023; Shiue and Keller 2023; Che 2023; Hess 2023).

Recently, family history information has also been used to make census records match up better automatically. This helps in studying how social mobility changed between generations in the U.S. during the 1800s and 1900s (Price et al. 2021). Also, information that people remember and report about their families has been used to get better estimates of how much social mobility there is between generations (Jácome, Kuziemko, and Naidu 2022).

## 1.4 

Lastly, this research paper shows big changes in how people moved up or down in society over several centuries. It also takes into account the most important social groups at the time, which were clans (large family groups). Usually, studies about social mobility in China or other places don't really look at how these group connections affect things because they don't have information from such long periods. Or, some studies using just last names suggest that social mobility doesn't change much over time (Hao and Clark 2012; Clark 2014).

**Footnote 11:** However, we know that moving between certain groups – for example, between Black and White people in the U.S. – is quite difficult. One problem with just using last names is that the low rates of mobility they find might partly reflect how difficult it is for entire groups to move up, rather than just individuals (Chetty et al. 2014). By considering the effects of clans in this study, I'm basically taking out these group differences. When I do that, the results show that the amount of social mobility actually looks higher. However, the results also show that even though clans helped keep families in similar social positions over time, the trends in social mobility still changed over time. This means that even with the influence of clans, social mobility still increased over the centuries.

### CENTRAL FEATURES OF CHINA’S ECONOMY, 1300–1900

Okay, so this piece of writing talks about a long period in history, from the late 1200s to the late 1800s. It looks at three big ruling families, called dynasties: part of the Yuan, the whole Ming, and most of the Qing.

During this time, the number of people living there went up a lot, from about 100 million to 400 million by the year 1900.

Even though how the government was set up changed over this long period, especially when you compare the Yuan to the later Ming and Qing, the real power was always held by one strong ruler in the middle and smaller government areas.

Compared to other countries, the government didn't take a lot of money in taxes. Also, how much buying and selling happened probably wasn't limited as much by government rules as it was by things like not having great ways to travel or good ways to handle money. This was partly because the government didn't spend enough money to really make sure rules were followed everywhere.

## 2.1

Alright, so the way the government worked was mostly run by smart, educated people who had passed special tests. Getting a good education was like the key to getting into richer social groups.

Because the main government in the middle didn't take a lot of taxes, it couldn't do everything itself. Instead, things like providing services for the public were often handled by the local governments and the important people in local family groups.

Even though these local leaders had a lot of influence over their own families, their involvement in making decisions for the whole country was made official through those government tests I mentioned earlier. Passing those tests gave them the right to be part of the bigger political system.

## 2.2

Okay, so during the time of the Ming and Qing dynasties, taking part in these big, competitive government tests was the best way to get respect and earn more money. If you passed the test and got a government job, it came with really good benefits and made you important in society.

These rewards were so appealing that even families who hadn't traditionally focused on education, but had become wealthy in other ways, started putting money into their sons' schooling. They saw it as a good investment.

On the one hand, when local powerful people passed these government tests, it made the central government stronger and more accepted. On the other hand, these local leaders who supported the government by taking these tests also got paid well. So, it was like the central government and the local important people had a partnership that benefited both sides. This created a kind of stable situation that was unique to China and different from how societies were organized in Europe, for example.

We know that local family groups were a big part of how society worked, but we don't know much yet about how these groups affected the economy.

## 2.3

So, basically, how much people could gain by investing in their education during this time was very closely tied to how well they did in the civil service exams.

In this writing, I'm going to use a key source of information that these family groups created, called the genealogy (which is like a family history). These genealogies help us understand "status" in a broader way because they show not only how well someone did in the exams and what government titles they held, but also other kinds of wealth they had that were clearly important.

In the next part, I'll talk more about where this information comes from.

### DATA

### Chinese Genealogies as a Family Archive

## 3.1

Imagine a family scrapbook, but instead of just pictures, it tells the story of your family going way, way back – hundreds of years! That's kind of what a Chinese genealogy is. It's like a super detailed family tree, but it doesn't just list names. It tells you about the men in the family, how they're connected through generations, and it also includes information about their wives and kids – like their names and when they were born or died.

These family history books started a long, long time ago, at least as far back as the Tang Dynasty (think ancient China!). People believed in honoring their ancestors, and the teachings of a famous philosopher named Confucius also emphasized family connections. By the time of the Ming and Qing Dynasties, keeping these family records became really common all across China.

So, a Chinese genealogy is a type of important historical paper, like other everyday documents people kept at home. Think of it like contracts, prayer books, or even tax records – things that families needed to remember important information within their society. One expert, Wang, has counted about 50,000 of these genealogies that are available for everyone to see. Most of these were made during the Ming and Qing Dynasties.

But get this – there are probably way more than 50,000 of these family history books out there! Lots of families still keep them private. And every year, more of these old genealogies become available for the public to see, maybe because libraries and local history lovers work hard to find and share them.

## 3.2

Since these family history books were basically made by the families themselves and kept at home, we need to think carefully about how complete and accurate they are.

For example, not every family had one of these genealogies in the first place. And just like old photos, some of these old family records have survived through time, while others have been lost or destroyed.

Also, the way these genealogies are set up focuses on the male side of the family. It follows the sons as they get married and have children. This means there's usually less information about daughters compared to sons.

Another thing to consider is that someone in the family had to be able to read and write to create these detailed records. So, families that had people who were educated might be more likely to have genealogies compared to families where no one could read or write. This could mean that the families with genealogies might have been wealthier or had more advantages.

Plus, sometimes families might have stretched the truth a little when writing their genealogies. For instance, they might have made the first person in their family sound more important than they actually were to make their family look better or to help them claim land. Or they might have tried to connect their family to a famous official from the past to boost their reputation.

Finally, these genealogies weren't all the same. Some were short and only included a few people, while others were huge, with many volumes covering different branches of a large family living across a whole province. This shows that there was a lot of variety in these family history records.

The main idea behind putting together Chinese family history books was that all the men in the family line had to be included for religious ceremonies. But there were also practical reasons – like money and social standing – why families kept track of their members.

Important studies by experts have helped us understand that these genealogies were like a tool for managing things. For example, they could help a family group control resources and protect themselves from other families trying to take their land (think of it like drawing lines on a map). They also showed who belonged to the family group and who owned land and other things together.

For business people, these genealogies could even help with agreements and contracts. And for everyone, they could be a way to organize how taxes were paid between families and the government.

No matter how you look at it, these family history books served some really important economic purposes for Chinese families. They weren't just about the past; they were also about managing the present and the future.

So, even though people basically declared themselves as part of a family group (or clan), being a member was a big deal. It helped everyone know who their allies were and what they were responsible for, especially when things got messy, like during conflicts where it might be unclear who owed what to whom.

In this way, the family history book acted like a shared record for the whole clan. It kept important and useful information about the family, such as the rules they lived by, details about property they owned together, and who had the right to benefit from that shared property. It might even include things like how much it cost to go to the family's school.

While these family rules could change as times changed, the careful way they recorded every little detail in the genealogy – like family charts, stories about people's lives, death notices, degrees people earned, and jobs they held – shows that the family group was a powerful way of organizing the community.

Because this document was so important and everyone in the family believed in its value, it probably meant people were more careful about keeping their family history accurate. It's different from the official government records from the Ming Dynasty, which were linked to taxes. People might have had reasons to lie in those government records to pay less tax. But with the family genealogies, everyone in the clan had a reason to make sure the information was correct.

## 3.5

Here's another way Chinese family history books were important for the economy, especially how China was run back in the Ming and Qing Dynasties.

The government, whether they said it directly or not, often left it up to local family groups (clans) to take care of many things in their own areas. This could include managing and fixing irrigation systems for farming, helping people who were poor, and storing grain in case of famines.

How much a clan could do depended on how much money and resources they had, and how many members were in the clan. For example, if the clan had its own school, the fees that members had to pay were often based on how much money each person made. The family history books, by keeping track of who was in the clan, helped provide a good idea of who had more income than others (as one expert, Chang, pointed out).

So, by documenting how the clans were organized, these genealogies helped the local clans be able to govern themselves and share risks within their communities without the direct involvement of the government. They were like an important record that supported this kind of local organization and cooperation.

## 3.6

So, to wrap it all up, these family history books that families kept themselves held a ton of important information. Even though we can't use them to create exact population counts like a census, and we have to remember that they focus more on the male side of the family, these genealogical records were really important for how society was organized and continued over time.

Genealogies weren't just around because people believed in honoring their ancestors. They were also widespread because they kept track of how families organized themselves economically and politically within their own communities. Plus, these family history books were valuable documents that families carefully protected. If they were full of mistakes, they wouldn't have been able to do their main jobs, which were to help with important economic and ceremonial activities. Now, let's talk about the information I used for this study.

### Sample Data: Coverage, Selection, and Representativeness

## 4.1

Okay, so picture this: we're looking at family history records from some groups of people who lived in a place called Tongcheng County in China way back in 1790. That's a pretty crowded place, like a busy city, with about 1.3 million people living there.

This county was in a good spot, near a big river called the lower Yangzi River, which helped it grow and become successful. It was also not too far from some important cities in Chinese history, like Nanjing and Beijing.

The land around Tongcheng was mostly used for growing rice, and the families that had the most money usually owned that land. Over many years, during the Ming and Qing Dynasties, this area became known for producing some really important and powerful government officials in China.

## 4.2

Okay, so using *all* the family history books from Tongcheng would be like looking at too many of the fancy families. To get a better picture of everyone, we need to pick the books carefully. The goal is to get a sample of people in our data that's like a good mix of the whole population.

Since we're interested in how people moved up or down in society (that's "social mobility"), it's important to remember that most people in these family books were just regular folks, what they call "commoners." Only a small percentage, maybe around 2%, were the really high-up people.

So, for the books we chose to study, we made sure to include *every single person* listed in them. Following these rules, we ended up using genealogies from seven different family groups: the Chen, Ma, Wang, Ye, Yin, Zhao, and Zhou families. This gave us information on about 40,000 people in total, including men, women, and children.

## 4.3

One thing we need to think about is how well these family history books actually represent *everyone* who lived in Tongcheng. If the books don't have complete information, then our picture of the past might be a little off.

A researcher named Harrell did a study where he compared information in family history records with official records in Taiwan from the early 1900s. He found that the family books actually listed over 80% of the people when compared to the really accurate Japanese household records. That's pretty good!

For our study in Tongcheng, it would be great to have super accurate official numbers for the population back then. But the problem is that the official records from China between the years 1300 and 1900 are kind of incomplete and not always reliable. So, we have to keep that in mind when we look at the information from the family history books.

## 4.4

Okay, so there's a graph, Figure 1, that shows two things: the official count of all the people in Tongcheng County and the total number of people in those seven families we're studying.

If you look at the official count for the whole county between the years 1400 and 1825, you'll see that they didn't count the population very often or regularly. It only happened about 20 times in over 400 years!

Also, the official numbers show that the population barely grew at all between the late 1400s and the early 1600s. That doesn't really make sense based on what we know about how populations usually change in China's history.

On the other hand, the number of people in our seven families changes more smoothly over time because we have information for every year.

It's not surprising that the official records from that time aren't perfect and are only available sometimes. But it does mean that we don't have a really good, reliable set of official numbers to compare our family history data to and see how well our sample represents everyone who lived in Tongcheng.

## 4.5

Even if the family history books don't give us the exact total number of people, they can still be really useful for other kinds of research. For example, if we want to compare different groups of people *within* the families over time, these books are a good way to do that.

To see if our sample of seven families is somewhat typical, we can compare what we find in their records to what other researchers have said about Chinese society back then. Of course, we have to remember that those other studies might also have some guesses or estimates in them.

For instance, a researcher named Fei thought that the wealthy, "leisure class" made up about the top 20% of the population. In my study, if we look at certain groups in a table (groups 2 to 22), they make up about 20.2% of all the people in our sample. These groups include people who maybe tried to pass the big government exams but didn't, village leaders, men with more than one wife, or people who bought official titles. So, the makeup of our sample seems to be in the ballpark of what other research suggests about the social classes at the time.

## 4.6

Also, I looked at how many really high-status people are in our family history books and compared that to what historical records say. A researcher named Chang said that if you counted people who had at least a certain level of academic title (called "sheng-yuan") as being in the upper class, they probably made up about the top 2% of everyone in the late Qing Dynasty.

In our sample of families, the people who fit Chang's definition make up about 3.4%. If we only count the men who actually passed the tough government exams to get an official title, that number drops to 1.9%.

These numbers suggest that our sample of families has a similar number of high-status people compared to what we generally think was true for China during that time. Plus, over 70% of the men in our sample don't show any signs of having a high social status, meaning they were likely just regular folks. Since most men in Tongcheng back then probably just had enough to get by, our sample seems to give us a good idea of what life was like for most people at the lower levels of society too.

## 4.7

I also looked at another set of family history information, called the "China Multigenerational Dataset," from a different part of China called Liaoning province. This data starts around the mid-1700s. In that dataset, about 2% of the people were listed as "Officials." In our Tongcheng family data, about 1.4% of the people had an official job.

The fact that we have a slightly smaller percentage of officials in our Tongcheng sample compared to the Liaoning data might be because the people in the Liaoning records had stronger connections to the government at that time than regular people in China usually did.

## 4.8

I also looked at another set of family history information, called the "China Multigenerational Dataset," from a different part of China called Liaoning province. This data starts around the mid-1700s. In that dataset, about 2% of the people were listed as "Officials." In our Tongcheng family data, about 1.4% of the people had an official job.

The fact that we have a slightly smaller percentage of officials in our Tongcheng sample compared to the Liaoning data might be because the people in the Liaoning records had stronger connections to the government at that time than regular people in China usually did.

## 4.9

Lastly, the number of really high-achieving scholars called "jinshi" that we found in our family records (there are 19 of them) matches the official lists kept by the Chinese government for Tongcheng. This makes us more confident that the information in these family books is accurate.

So, even though our sample of families and the way we define social status might be a little different from other studies, overall, the way status is spread out in our sample looks pretty similar to what other research has found for China during this time.

In the next part, we're going to look even closer at how we chose our families by comparing them to each other.
