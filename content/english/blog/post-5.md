Imagine a really long family history project, but instead of just your family, it's about seven different families in a specific area of China (Tongcheng County) going all the way back 600 years!

Here's what the study looked at;

They looked at families across many generations: They focused on fathers and their sons for 18 generations, which is a huge amount of time! This means they had information on about 40,000 people.
They looked at all kinds of people: These families weren't all rich or all poor. They included everyone from regular folks to people who had earned a very high-level academic degree called a "jinshi." Think of it like having a PhD back then, which opened doors to important jobs.
They wanted to see how much people's social class changed over time: This is what "intergenerational mobility" means. Did a farmer's son also become a farmer, or did he have a chance to become something else, maybe even a highly educated official? Did the sons of those high-ranking officials stay at the top?
What they found:
Change was slow but it happened: For a long time, people's social class didn't change much from one generation to the next.
Things got a lot more mobile in the 1600s: Suddenly, it became more likely for people to move up or down the social ladder.
The timing makes sense: This change in the 1600s lines up with other important historical events that would have affected opportunities for both regular people and the highly educated.
Something interesting about inequality: They also found that when there was less social mobility (meaning people tended to stay in the same social class as their parents), there was more inequality in society. This is like saying if it's hard to move up, the gap between the rich and poor tends to be bigger. This idea is called the "Great Gatsby curve," and this study found evidence of it happening over time, not just at one point in time.
So, in simpler terms, this study used a massive amount of family history data to see how much people's social standing changed in China over six centuries. They discovered that while change was gradual, there was a significant period of increased social movement in the 1600s, and they also found a connection between how easy it was to move up or down in society and how unequal society was overall. Pretty cool, right?

## intergenerational mobility

Think about it like this: intergenerational mobility is basically how likely it is for kids to end up in a different income bracket than their parents. If there's high mobility, it means a kid born into a poor family has a good chance of becoming wealthy, and vice versa. If there's low mobility, kids tend to stay in the same economic situation as their parents.

This idea of intergenerational mobility is a really important way to understand how fair or equal an economy is.

Recently, studies comparing different regions today have shown that there can be big differences in how much mobility there is. These differences might be because of things like:

Government taxes: How the government collects and spends money.
Neighborhoods: The kind of community someone grows up in.
Community groups: Things like local clubs or organizations.
Innate population characteristics: This is a bit more complex, but it could refer to things like the general skills or education levels of people in a region.
Other stuff: Basically, lots of different factors can play a role.
Now, when we try to understand how mobility worked before the 1800s, it gets much harder. We don't have as much information.

One of the big problems with studying how mobility changes over time is that things that are passed down through families (like maybe certain skills or connections) don't usually change very quickly. So, if we only look at parents and their kids, or even grandparents and grandkids, that might not be enough time to see a real trend. We need to look at many, many generations to really understand how social mobility has changed over long periods.

So, this paragraph is basically saying that understanding how much kids' economic futures are tied to their parents' is key to understanding an economy. We know that different things now can affect this mobility. But it's tough to know how it worked way back in the past because things that influence it change slowly, so we need to study many generations to see any real changes over time.

## Ancient Chinese Exams

Okay, imagine historians who study China have always been super curious about how easy it was for people to move up or down in society. They've especially focused on how people got into and out of the top levels of society – like becoming powerful officials.

Think of it like this: they're trying to figure out if China was a place where anyone could become the "cool kids" or if the "cool kids" always stayed the same families.

One famous historian named Ho, who studied the Ming and Qing dynasties (a long time ago in China), said that the big civil service exams were the most important thing for deciding your social status. He even thought these exams became more important than just being from a fancy family. Basically, he argued that doing well on these tests could make you important, even if your family wasn't.

Another historian, Kracke, asked a similar question: "Did these civil service exams bring in new people from different backgrounds into the government?" He wanted to know if it was a way for people who weren't born into privilege to get important jobs.

Even before Kracke, a writer named Wittfogel looked at the biographies of officials from way back in Chinese history (from the Tang to the Qing dynasties). He thought that while the exam system might have let some new people in from lower social classes, for the most part, the powerful officials were mostly coming from families who were already powerful. It was like the "ruling class" mostly stayed within itself.

To get a better idea, Kracke looked at who got the highest degree, called the jinshi degree, before the Ming dynasty. He tried to find out what the fathers, grandfathers, and great-grandfathers of these successful students did. This helped him see if these high achievers came from families with a history of being important.

Ho also did something similar but for the entire Ming dynasty. He looked at all the people who got the top jinshi degree (over 22,000 of them!). He found that only a small percentage – about 7 out of every 100 – came from families that were officially known as "scholar" families. This suggests that maybe the exams did create some opportunities for people from less privileged backgrounds to rise to the top.

So, basically, these historians were trying to figure out how people became important in China's past. They were especially interested in whether the civil service exams were a fair way for anyone to move up in society or if being from a well-known family was still the most important thing. Their research gives us clues about how open or closed Chinese society was at different times.

## Kracke and Ho

Okay, so even though historians like Kracke and Ho found that it seemed easier than expected for people to move into the highest levels of Chinese society, it's not something everyone agrees on.

Think of it like this: they found some evidence that the "cool kids" club wasn't always made up of the same families. People from less privileged backgrounds could sometimes work their way in.

However, more recent research, often looking at family history records (genealogies), has pointed out many cases where the rich and powerful families managed to stay rich and powerful for generations. It's like some families just had a knack for staying on top.

Ho himself even mentioned that the evidence he and others had about this "social fluidity" (how easily people could move up or down) was mostly based on stories, family trees, novels, and what people at the time said about clans and families. It wasn't always hard, cold numbers.

But, Ho also used family trees to show that even high-status families could lose their position if their kids or grandkids weren't capable. So, it wasn't always guaranteed that you'd stay on top just because your parents were.

Basically, what this paragraph is saying is that the picture is complicated. History shows us examples of families that stayed powerful for a long time, but also examples of powerful families losing their status. So, while there might have been some opportunities for people to move up, it wasn't always a one-way street, and the old powerful families still had ways of trying to stay in charge. It's a mix of things.

## Father and Son

Okay, so we've talked a lot about the fancy folks and how they moved up or down. But what about everyone else – the regular people who weren't part of the elite? We don't know as much about their social mobility during the Ming and Qing dynasties.

That's where this research paper comes in! The person who wrote it is saying, "Hey, I'm going to use all the cool information in those Chinese family history books (genealogies) to actually measure how social mobility changed over time for everyone, not just the top guys."

They looked at a wide range of social classes, from everyday commoners all the way up to those who got the super prestigious jinshi degree.

Here's what they did:

They looked at a specific place and families: They studied seven different families (clans) living in Tongcheng County over a long period, from around the 1300s to the 1900s.
They tracked a lot of people: They had information on about 9,800 men and almost 9,000 father-son pairs in their sample. Around the year 1790, this group of people made up about 2% of the total population of that county.
Where was this place? Tongcheng County was located in a certain area of China, near a big river and not too far from the sea.1   

## Gyna-what?

Okay, so think of these genealogies – those Chinese family history books we've been talking about – as really valuable sources of information about people's social and economic lives way back then.

The author even points out that while not every country keeps these kinds of detailed family records, when they do exist (like in China), they're considered a super reliable way to study how people's status changes over many generations. In fact, for linking historical information about families in the United States, they've even been called "the gold standard" – meaning the very best!

However, there's a potential problem: not every single family in China kept a genealogy. So, the families we do have records for might not be a perfect representation of everyone. It's like if you only surveyed people who owned fancy cars – you wouldn't get a good idea of what most people drive.

To deal with this potential bias (where the families we study might be special in some way), the author explains that they used a careful method to pick the families in their study. They tried to choose families in a way that would give them a sample that was more like a good cross-section of society at the time.

Because of this careful selection, the people in their study come from all sorts of backgrounds. There are very few people who achieved that super high jinshi degree (only about 0.2% of their sample), which makes sense because it was really hard to get. And the majority of the people in their sample (around 70%) were regular, everyday folks (commoners), which also reflects what society was probably like back then.

So, this paragraph is saying that these family history books are great for studying social mobility, but you have to be careful about which families you look at. The author made an effort to pick families that represent the different social classes in China at the time, so their findings are more likely to give us a realistic picture.

## The Matrices

So, the author looked at their data from those family history books and created something called "transition matrices." Think of these like charts that show how likely it was for someone to move from one social class to another between generations (from father to son).

What they found for the jinshi (the super high-achievers) was interesting. They discovered that about 7% of fathers who were jinshi also had sons who became jinshi. Guess what? That's very close to the 7.1% that the historian Ho found in his research! It's like their numbers match up.

However, the author has a slightly different way of looking at this compared to Ho. While Ho might have seen this as some level of movement (since not all jinshi fathers had jinshi sons), this author sees it as a sign that family status tended to stick around at the top.

Here's why: the author also found that for every three sons of a jinshi, one of them (that's about 33%) stayed within the top 2% of the social ladder. Think of it like the very top of the pyramid – even if they didn't get the exact same jinshi title, they still remained in a very elite group.

The author also points out something really cool that you can't find in official government records: they were able to track how people moved within the groups just below the elite and even among the regular, non-elite folks. So, they got a much broader picture of social mobility across all levels of society, not just at the very top.

In simple terms: even though not every jinshi father had a jinshi son, the author's research suggests that if you were from a top family, there was a pretty good chance your son would also end up near the top. Plus, they were able to see how mobility worked for everyone else in society, which is something we didn't really know much about before.

## 50-50

Okay, imagine a game where your parents give you a head start in life, maybe because they have more money or better connections. This research suggests that whatever advantage your parents give you, it gets cut in half in your generation. So, if your parents gave you a 10-point advantage, you'd likely only have a 5-point advantage over someone whose parents didn't have those resources.

However, this average picture hides some really interesting changes that happened over time, both for people moving up and for people moving down the social ladder.

What the study found is that mobility increased over time, both ways:

Upward mobility increased: This means that fewer sons born into poor families stayed poor as time went on. They had a better chance of climbing up the social ladder.
Downward mobility increased: This also means that fewer sons from very rich families stayed very rich. There was a greater chance they might fall down the social ladder.
Interestingly, this wasn't always the case. The study suggests that mobility was low until around the middle of the 1600s. It was harder for people to change their social standing. But then, starting from the late 1600s, mobility increased significantly. Things became more fluid, with more movement both up and down.

Overall, the main takeaway is that the advantage that kids from high-status families had over kids from lower-status families got smaller over time. It became less guaranteed that you'd stay rich if your parents were rich, and it became more possible to climb out of poverty. The author says that this increase in mobility is a pretty solid finding, even when they checked their results in different ways.

So, in simpler terms: while your parents' advantages still give you a boost, that boost isn't as strong as it used to be, and over time, it became easier for people to move up or down the social ladder, especially after the 1600s.

## Ka-Qing

Okay, so why did this increase in social mobility happen after the 1600s? The author suggests we need to look at how much the economy valued skills and education during that time, both in terms of what was actually happening historically and the rules and systems that were in place.

Think of it like this: if the economy starts to reward people more for what they know and what they can do (their skills and education) rather than just who their parents are, then you'd expect to see more social mobility. People from less privileged backgrounds could climb up if they gained valuable skills. Also, people from wealthy families might fall if they didn't develop those skills.

The author points out that the timing of this increase in mobility roughly lines up with the beginning of new policies that the Qing Dynasty put in place in the 1600s. 1  This suggests that these new rules and systems might have played a role in making society more mobile. Perhaps these policies created more opportunities for people with skills and education, regardless of their family background

So, in simple terms: the shift towards more social mobility after the 1600s might be because the economy started valuing what you learned and what you could do more than just your family name. And this change seems to have happened around the same time that the new government (the Qing Dynasty) started introducing new rules and ways of doing things. These new policies might have opened up more paths for people to move up or down the social ladder based on their own abilities.

## The Great Gatsby

Okay, so when how much you earn depends more on your skills and education (what economists call "return to human capital"), it doesn't just affect how easy it is to move up or down in society (mobility). It also affects how unequal society is.

Think about it this way: if everyone has a chance to gain skills and get educated, and those things lead to better jobs and higher pay, then the gap between the rich and the poor might shrink. More people have a shot at doing well.

The author points out that this connection between mobility and inequality has been seen in studies comparing different regions today. This idea is known as the Great Gatsby curve, which basically says that places with less social mobility tend to have more income inequality.

What's really interesting is that this study found the same pattern happening over time in China. As social mobility increased (meaning it became easier to move up or down), income inequality actually decreased. It's like the pie was being shared more evenly.

So, the author is showing that the changes they observed in China over centuries have something fundamental in common with what we see when we compare different places in the world today. When there's more opportunity for people to change their social standing, there tends to be less of a gap between the rich and the poor. It's like these two things – mobility and equality – are connected.

## Pseudo Science

Alright, let's break down how this research paper adds to what we know:

This study helps us understand how social mobility worked during the Ming and Qing Dynasties (a long time ago in China). Before this, we didn't have a lot of hard numbers or statistical analysis on this topic. Most of what we knew was based on stories and less concrete evidence.

Think of it like trying to understand the weather from old diaries instead of having actual temperature readings and weather maps.

For periods in history before governments started collecting really good, representative data (like detailed census information), researchers have had to get creative. They've used things called "pseudo-links," which are often based on people having the same last name. The idea is that if people share a rare surname, they might be related, and you can try to track them that way.

These older methods are useful and can give us some clues, and this new paper using family histories (genealogies) adds another important piece to the puzzle.

While these family history books might not have information on every single person like a census would, they have a big advantage when it comes to following families across generations. The relationships – who the parents and children are – are clearly laid out in the genealogies. It's like having a ready-made family tree that shows the connections directly.

So, this paper uses these family trees to give us a more direct way of seeing how social status was passed down (or not) from one generation to the next, which is a key part of understanding intergenerational mobility. It's adding a new and valuable type of evidence to the historical picture.

## Up-low, Down-top

Okay, so remember how some important studies about social mobility in China, like the one by Ho, mostly looked at the very top people – the 1 to 5 percent who did really well in those tough civil service exams?

Well, the family history records (genealogies) let us look at a wider idea of "status." It's not just about getting those top exam scores. We can also see people who might have been wealthy or had some social standing even if they didn't have super high levels of education. Think of successful merchants or landowners – they might not have been top scholars, but they still had a certain level of status.

What's really important about this research paper is that it looks at a sample where more than 70 percent of the men were not elites. This group includes regular commoners and people from lower social classes.

So, this study is doing something new! It's not just focusing on the tiny sliver at the very top. It's digging into the lives and the mobility patterns of the vast majority of China's population – the everyday people. This means the results of this paper give us a much better and broader understanding of how social mobility worked for most people in China during that time, not just for the super-achieving scholars. It's like finally getting to see the whole picture instead of just a small corner of it.

## Donuts ,Danishe's,and snuff 

Okay, so this paper also connects to a lot of other research that looks at social mobility, both in the world today and going back to the 1800s. Many of these studies use a method called the "intergenerational regression approach." Think of this as a way of statistically measuring how much your parents' social or economic status influences your own.

The author mentions that their research shows a big change over several centuries in something called the "generational coefficient." This is a number that tells you how strongly your parents' status predicts your status. In this study, that number went down from 0.7 to 0.4. A lower number means that your parents' status has less of a hold on your future – in other words, more mobility.

The author then compares this finding to other studies:

One study found some changes in social mobility in Germany since the late 1800s.
Another study suggested that social mobility in the U.S. has actually decreased since 1880.
Studies on 19th-century Sweden found mobility estimates somewhere in the middle.
Research on 19th-century jobs in the U.S. and the UK found even higher levels of mobility (a lower coefficient).
The author points out that the fact that social mobility can be different in different regions might explain why these other studies have different results. By looking at how this "generational coefficient" changed over time in the same region of China, this paper aims to give us a better understanding of how mobility changes across different periods, which is something we don't know as much about compared to how mobility differs from place to place.

So, in simple terms: this research fits into a bigger picture of studies trying to measure how much parents influence their children's social standing. By tracking this influence over a long period in one specific area of China, this paper helps us understand how social mobility can change over time, adding to what we know from comparing different countries or time periods.
